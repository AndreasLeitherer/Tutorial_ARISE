In this tutorial, we discuss the crytal-structure recognition framework ARISE introduced in 

A. Leitherer, A. Ziletti, and L. M. Ghiringhelli, arXiv:2103.09777, (2021) 

This approach employs Bayesian deep learning to classify more than 100 crystal structures in robust fashion, providing principled uncertainty estimates alongside classifications. ARISE can be applied for the analysis of single- and polycrystalline data.
