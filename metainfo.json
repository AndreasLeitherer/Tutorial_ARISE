  "title": "ARISE - Robust recognition and exploratory analysis of crystal structures via Bayesian deep learning",
  "description": "In this tutorial, we give an introduction to ARISE ((ARtificial-Intelligence-based Structure Evaluation), a powerful Bayesian-deep-neural-network tool for the recognition of atomistic structures. ARISE is robust to structural noise and can treat more than 100 crystal structures, a number that can be extended on demand. While being trained on ideal structures only, ARISE correctly characterizes strongly perturbed single- and polycrystalline systems, from both synthetic and experimental resources. The probabilistic nature of the Bayesian-deep-learning model allows to obtain principled uncertainty estimates. By applying unsupervised learning to the internal neural-network representations, one can reveal grain boundaries and (unapparent) structural regions sharing easily interpretable geometrical properties.",
